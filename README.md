# Stacks-ADT
A stack  is a data structure that stores a linear collection of items with access limited to a last in first -outer.<br />
In stacks, adding and removing of items is restricted to one end known as the top of the slack.<br />

# Some of the used functions
Stack() -> Creates an empty stack.<br />
isEmpty or is_empty() -> Returns a boolean values to tell whether the stack is empty or it has items.<br />
length() -> Returns the number of items in the stack.<br />
pop() -> Removes and returns the top of item of the stack.<br />
peek() -> Returns a reference to the item on top of the non-empty stack without removing it.<br />
push() -> Adds the given item to the top of a stack.

### A stack is not a built in function therefore we define it as a class.
