# Stacks-ADT
A stack  is a data structure that stores a linear collection of items with access limited to a last in first -outer.
In stacks, adding and removing of items is restricted to one end known as the top of the slack.

#Some of the used functions
Stack() -> Creates an empty stack\n
isEmpty or is_empty() -> Returns a boolean values to tell whether the stack is empty or it has items
length() -> Returns the number of items in the stack
pop() -> Removes and returns the top of item of the stack
peek() -> Returns a reference to the item on top of the non-empty stack without removing it
push() -> Adds the given item to the top of a stack

#A stack is not a built in function therefore we define it as a class
